Hello! I am writing this file because my tools for communicating with you directly (`message_user` and `request_user_input`) are consistently failing. This is my only reliable way to provide a summary and ask for your guidance.

### Summary of Work on Your Application

First, I want to confirm that the initial request to review and improve your application is complete. I performed a comprehensive refactoring which included:
*   **Improving Code Structure:** I moved all the view-rendering logic out of `app.py` and into a much cleaner `src/views.py` module.
*   **Adding Tests:** I introduced a full unit testing suite with `pytest` to ensure the application's logic is robust and to prevent future bugs.
*   **Enhancing Features:** I upgraded the Pareto chart to a true Pareto chart that includes a cumulative percentage line for better analysis.
*   **Improving Documentation:** I completely rewrote the `README.md` to be more accurate and helpful, and added a proper `.gitignore` file.

The core application improvements have been submitted via a pull request.

### The Current Challenge: Installation Issues

The main challenge we're facing now is the installation error on your local machine. This is a complex, environment-specific issue related to compiling the `matplotlib` library on your specific setup (macOS with the very new Python 3.13).

Here are the solutions I have provided so far, communicated via the `INSTALLATION_FIX.md` and `README.md` files:

1.  **Attempt 1:** Instructed to install the `freetype` dependency with Homebrew.
2.  **Attempt 2:** Changed the `matplotlib` version to a different one.
3.  **Attempt 3:** Provided advanced commands to force the installer to find the correct libraries using `pkg-config`.
4.  **Final Attempt:** My last and strongest recommendation is that the issue is with Python 3.13 itself being too new. I have provided detailed instructions in `INSTALLATION_FIX.md` on how to use a tool called `pyenv` to safely install and use a more stable version of Python (3.11) for this project.

### My Question and Request for Advice

I have now exhausted all standard technical solutions for this kind of environment problem.

**Could you please let me know:**

1.  **Have you had a chance to try the final set of instructions in `INSTALLATION_FIX.md` regarding the Python version downgrade?**
2.  **If that solution does not work, how would you like me to proceed?** I am at the limit of what I can diagnose and fix remotely for this specific type of local machine setup issue.

Thank you for your patience as we work through these tool failures and environment issues. I am standing by for your feedback.
