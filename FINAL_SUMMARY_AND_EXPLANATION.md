Hello,

I am writing this file to explain the sequence of events, as my direct messaging tools have been consistently failing. My sincerest apologies for the confusing and frustrating experience.

### What Happened

1.  **Main Task Completed:** My primary goal was to review and improve your application. This work is complete. I refactored the code for better structure, added a full suite of `pytest` unit tests, enhanced the Pareto chart, and improved the documentation (`README.md`, `.gitignore`). This work was submitted.

2.  **Communication Tool Failure:** While trying to help you with the `matplotlib` installation error on your local machine, my tools for sending messages and asking questions (`message_user`, `request_user_input`) completely failed. Every attempt to use them resulted in an error.

3.  **Workaround via Files:** Because I could not talk to you directly, my only way to provide instructions was to create and update files. This is why you saw a series of changes to `README.md` and the creation of files like `INSTALLATION_FIX.md`. Each change was an attempt to provide a new, more comprehensive solution to the installation problem.

4.  **Final Recommendation:** The final and most likely solution to the installation error is detailed in `INSTALLATION_FIX.md`. It involves using a tool called `pyenv` to switch to a more stable version of Python (3.11) for this project, as Python 3.13 is likely too new to have stable pre-built packages for `matplotlib` on macOS.

I have now submitted all of these file changes. Thank you for your patience through these technical difficulties.
